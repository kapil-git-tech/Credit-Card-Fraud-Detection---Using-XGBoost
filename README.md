### About this file: You can find the description here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. The above link is also the home of the dataset. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.


## This is an XGBoost model to identify the fraudulent transactions, covering:

* Train/Test split
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Plotting ROC/AUC/Cost_function
* Exploring trees (lookking at an example tree)
* Distribution of class on the predicted probabilities
